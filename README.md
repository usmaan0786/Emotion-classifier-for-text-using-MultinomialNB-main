# Emotion-classifier-for-text-using-MultinomialNB
- "Emotion Classifier for Text using MultinomialNB" is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying emotions in textual data.
- The project involves pre-processing the textual data by cleaning, tokenizing, and vectorizing the text.
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB) classifier is trained on the pre-processed textual data to classify emotions such as happiness😁, sadness😔, anger😠, and fear😨.
